The Blood Management System is a C-based program designed to efficiently manage user accounts, donors, and blood requests through the use of a doubly linked list structure. The system incorporates three primary data structures: the User, Donor, and Blood Request structures. The User structure stores essential information such as name, username, password, email, age, and user type, linking each user to the next and previous users. The Donor structure captures donor-specific details like name, blood type, age, email, and phone number, while the Blood Request structure manages requests for blood, including details about the patient, blood group, quantity, hospital information, contact details, and request status.

The system offers several key functions for managing users, donors, and blood requests. User management functions include adding, editing, deleting, and viewing user details, as well as handling user authentication and password changes. Donor management allows for adding, deleting, viewing, and searching for donors within the system. Blood request management functions facilitate the addition, deletion, editing, and viewing of blood requests, along with searching for requests and approving or rejecting them.

The program's user interface is organized into menus. The main menu allows users to log in, create an account, change passwords, or exit the program. Upon logging in, users are directed to either the admin menu or the user menu, depending on their user type. The admin menu provides access to full system management, including managing users, donors, and blood requests, while regular users have limited access focused on viewing and managing their own requests. Overall, the Blood Management System is designed to streamline blood donation management, ensuring that users and administrators can interact with the system efficiently and effectively.
