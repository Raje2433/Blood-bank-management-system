The objective of this project is to create a Blood Bank Management System with a user-friendly interface that 
allows for easy management of blood donation, recipient and inventory information. The system provides secure login
for both users and administrators, with the ability for users to request blood and administrators to manage user profiles 
and blood inventory. The system also allows administrators to generate reports for blood donations, recipients, 
and inventory. The overall goal is to create a streamlined and efficient system for managing blood bank operations, 
ensuring that blood is available when needed and reducing the risk of shortages.
